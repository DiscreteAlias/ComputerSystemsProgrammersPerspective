# Computer Systems: A Programmer's Persepective

This repository contains my notes, code examples, and exercise answers from reading **_Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective_**. 

## Overview 
The goal of this repository is to provide a structured resource for understanding the concepts covered in the book. Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect of computer systems, and I have organized the content to align with the book's structure. 

### Contents
